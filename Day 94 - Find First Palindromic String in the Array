QUESTION :-

Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
Output: "racecar"
Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
Example 3:

Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.

SOLUTION :-

class Solution {
    public String firstPalindrome(String[] words) {
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < words.length ; i++){
            String str = words[i];
            boolean x = palindrome(str);
            if(x){
                return words[i];
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
    public boolean palindrome(String a){
        String b = "";
        for(int i = a.length()-1 ;i>=0 ;i--){
            b = b + a.charAt(i);
        }
        return b.equals(a);
    }
}
